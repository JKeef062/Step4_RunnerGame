# Step4_RunnerGame
This repo has two folders; the Step4ever folder holds all previous versions of the game, and the Final_Game folder holds the finished product. This game can be accessed and/or played three ways. You may play the game by simply following this link https://step4.herokuapp.com, downloading the .exe file from Final_Game to run the game on your local machine, or if you have the Unity game development engine installed on your machine, you may clone the entire repo and open the file Step4ever in Unity to make your own additions.

Postscript: This repo was used when building the game and as such contains many previous versions. If you wish to get only the final project please see the Final_Game folder.
